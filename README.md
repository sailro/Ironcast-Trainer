[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsor-%E2%9D%A4-lightgrey?logo=github&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/sponsors/sailro)

A very simple trainer for the excellent [IronCast](http://store.steampowered.com/app/327670/) game.
This trainer was built using [TrainerKit](https://github.com/sailro/TrainerKit)

How to use the trainer:
- Run load.bat to inject the trainer into the process (you do not need to copy files in a specific location).
- Use keypad + to add 1000 scraps
- Use keypad * to add 1000 war assets
- Use keypad . to add 10000 xp
- By default health/ammo/coolant/energy/repair will be set to the maximum

You can compile everything or simply use the [demo release](https://github.com/sailro/Ironcast-Trainer/releases).

Have fun !
